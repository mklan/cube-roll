# cubeRoll
a small WebGL game, to demonstrate streaming games for dedicated gaming

the game uses a canvas streaming library [https://github.com/mklan/canvasStreamer] to stream the game over WebRTC to a client for remote gaming.


> __Warning:__ The deployed demo is not working anymore, because the peerjs cloud does not support tls connections and the github pages ist switched to enforcing https connections.


here is a playable Demo:

you can stream and play this game remote with this client on any other machine or another browser window.
